ultisnip-rspec
==============

RSpec snippets for UltiSnips.

If you use pathogen, just clone into your bundle directory.
There is no extra configuration to get this working.

This plugin also configures a filetype, 'rspec.ruby', and then uses it.
This means that the snippets contained inside only work with \_spec.rb files.

NOTICE - I found these snippets online. I am not the author. I just tried to
make them easily reachable by everyone. If you are the author, and you'd like
to have your name here, just let me know!
